<div class="title">Towards declarative touch interactions</div>
<div class="subtitle">by <a href="mailto:ralpht@gmail.com">Ralph Thomas</a><br>January 2015</div>
<p>This page outlines a system for concisely describing and implementing a class of touch interactions called Slalom. Currently most touch interactions are implemented by writing new code to handle every touch movement which computes various transforms and updates the view tree or DOM. This code is repetitive to write and is frequently inflexible, and the author needs a reasonable understanding of Newtonian physics to create something that feels "good" to use. As a result most apps use only the touch interactions provided by the operating system: scroll and tap.</p>
<p>Many touch interactions involve dragging a visual object (and it following the touch point) and imparting momentum to it so that when released it keeps moving with some momentum. Additionally there are some constraints imposed on how and where an object can move. What if we could come up with a system where we just specify how something moves and what the constraints are?</p>
<p>Slalom is a combination of the Cassowary linear constraints solver with a minimal physics engine which solves a class of touch interactions declaratively. It's broken into several components:</p>
<ul>
 <li><b>Linear constraints</b>&mdash;linear constraints are used to place objects relative to each other, and to restrict how they can move. Slalom uses the Cassowary linear constraint solver which is based on Danzig's Simplex algorithm (this is important later). Cassowary has found a niche in 2D layout recently (it's the solver used by Apple's AutoLayout and Grid Style Sheets). If we think of a touch interaction as a slot-car game, then the linear constraints let us define the track. For example, this is how we'd use linear constraints to position an image that's wider than its parent, allowing the image to scroll:<br>XXX CODE</li>
 <li><b>Manipulator</b>&mdash;a manipulator listens for touch events and updates a Cassowary variable in response. When the touch gesture ends it knows how to use the momentum to create an animation. In our slot-car metaphor the manipulator is both the controller and car. To make our image draggable, we would create a manipulator for it like this:<br>XXX CODE<br>Notice how now we can drag the image, but it goes too far to either side.</li>
 <li><b>Motion Constraints</b>&mdash;these place limits on how far an object can move, or where it can stop. They're similar to the linear constraints, except they're enforced by physics simulations (typically springs) so that when a variable being controlled by a manipulator violates a motion constraint it bounces or undertracks the finger. Motion constraints would be like a rubber band stretched across the track of our slot-car, or like jam on the track, or a speed bump. We can add motion constraints to our image example like this:<br>XXX CODE</li>
</ul>
<p>We just described full momentum scrolling with one manipulator and two motion constraints. It handles all of the tricky edge cases, like when you start dragging while the photo is already bouncing on one of the edges, or if you impart momentum while in the overdrag. In systems where there are multiple manipulators, Slalom identifies the correct manipulator that is causing a motion constraint violation and applies feedback to it.</p>
<p>Here are some more examples with links to the source. In all cases there's significantly less code and the code is cleaner using Slalom than the imperative alternative.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<i>Drag these lists vertically</i><br>
<div class="scrolling-example" id="scrolling-example"></div>
<div class="scrolling-example" id="android-notifications"></div><br>
</div>
<div class="constraints">
<b>Constraints:</b><br>
The list items are 40px tall:
<div class="mono">panel[i].bottom = panel[i].y + 40</div>
The list items are stacked vertically in a column, with a 10px gap:
<div class="mono">panel[i].y = panel[i-1].bottom + 10</div>
<b>Motion constraints:</b><br>
The first list item can't have a value more than zero:
<div class="mono">panel[first].y &lt;= 0 <b>spring</b></div>
The last list item's bottom can't be more than the parent height:
<div class="mono">panel[last].bottom &gt;= parentHeight <b>spring</b></div>
</div>
<div class="content">
<p>Second example is the "Panels" UI from the old Twitter for iPad. It doesn't feel like scrolling at all to use (the panels each half the width of the screen or more, and it implements snap points which I have yet to come up with a motion constraint for). Notice how the panels bounce relative to each other when animating back from the motion constraint.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<i>Drag the panels horizontally and release to impart velocity.</i>
<div class="cards-container" id="twitter-panels-example"></div>
<i>Notice how these panels animate to either be open or closed.</i>
<div class="cards-container" id="twitter-panels-example-constrain"></div>
</div>
<div class="constraints">
<b>Constraints:</b><br>
The left edge of each panel can't go past the left edge of the panel that came before, plus 10px.
<div class="mono">panel[i].x &gt; panel[i-1].x + 10</div>
The left edge of each panel can't go past the right edge of the panel that came before.
<div class="mono">panel[i].x &lt; panel[i-1].right</div>
<b>Motion constraint:</b><br>
The first panel's left edge is pinned to zero. This is motion constraint meaning that when violated it has a physical effect on the system. Here it applies a spring, but it could rebound or completely stop the motion.
<div class="mono">panel[first].left = 0 <b>spring</b></div>

<p>Scaling. This is using a vertical drag to do scaling. With more flexible gesture processing we could use the horizontal part of the gesture to scroll horizontally, too.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<i>Drag the image upwards to grow it.</i>
<div class="scaling-example" id="scaling-example"></div>
</div>
<div class="constraints">
We manipulate the box's "y" variable for vertical drags.<br>
<b>Constraints:</b><br>
Constrain the aspect ratio of the box (aspect = parentWidth / parentHeight):
<div class="mono">box.width = box.height * aspect</div>
Relate the height to the scale:
<div class="mono">box.height = scale * parentHeight</div>
Pin the box to the bottom of the screen:
<div class="mono">box.bottom = parentHeight</div>
Center the box horizontally:
<div class="mono">(box.x + box.width/2) = parentWidth / 2</div>
<b>Motion Constraints:</b><br>
The box's width must be greater than 150px. We're really expressing a constraint on the minimum scale, but because we can get the coefficients out of Cassowary, we can write this in terms of the box's width.
<div class="mono">box.width &gt;= 150 spring</div>
The box's top mustn't go above the top of the screen. Again, this is really a scale constraint (the scale can't be more than 1.0), but we're expressing it in terms of box.y because that's more natural.
<div class="mono">box.y &gt;= 0 spring</div>
<b>Notes:</b><br>
<ul>
 <li>We can tweak the constraints to make the box go off the bottom when it gets to small instead of shrinking further and things like that. So we have a lot of flexibility with this kind of system.</li>
 <li>There's slip! If you drag from the middle of the box, you'll see that the part of the image you grabbed slips out from under your finger. That's because the manipulator is just operating on the box's y coordinate. If we wanted to avoid slip then we'd have to create a new variable when the finger goes down, relate it to y (i.e.: <span class="mono">fingery = box.y - 123 * scale</span>, based on the current scale and finger start position) and then manipulate <span class="mono">fingery</span> instead of <span class="mono">box.y</span>. This isn't very hard, but the current Manipulator code doesn't support it.</li>
